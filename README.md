# transport
This is a project to a Software Engineering undergraduate course. It's main goal was to develop a simple website to a transports company, using various software engineering resources, such as as making UML diagrams and using a test framework to test each part of the project.

The site was made using Express and NodeJS to the back-end, VueJS for the front-end and MongoDB to database access. Then, Docker was used to containerize the site, and cypress was used to make unit and system-wide tests. UML diagrams were also created to decide which parts of the site would have priority. The use cases chosen to this project were the user's login and buying tickets to a trip.
